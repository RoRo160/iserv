This module provides an easy way to communicate with your IServ account.
I reverse-engineered parts of the internal IServ api and recreated some http requests your browser would do in the 
background.

### Features:

### Coming soon:

> **WARNING:** <br/> 
> This module does **NOT** use an official api! <br/>
> Extensive usage might lead to problems with your IServ account. <br/>
