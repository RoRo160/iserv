`Made by RoRo160` `v.0.01.0-beta`

This module provides an easy way to communicate with your IServ account.
I reverse-engineered parts of the internal IServ api and recreated some http requests your browser would do in the 
background.

> ðŸ”´ **WARNING:** <br/> 
> This module does **NOT** use an official api!
> 
> Extensive usage might lead to problems with your IServ account.
> 
> **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!**

### Features:

- Login/Logout with your IServ account
- Plan changes, by week, day, filtered by course
- Get all tasks

### Coming soon:

- Read all your emails
- Notifications

## Usage:

> âš  **Note:**
> To run you might need to install some dependencies.
> 
> Do that by running the following command: 
> ````shell 
> pip install -r requirements.txt 
> ````

### Login/Logout:
````python
from iserv import *

# create IServ object, link your IServ server 
# (please add "https://" before domain name and don't add a "/" at the end!)
iserv = IServ("https://your.iserv.example")

# login to your account
iserv.login("your.username", "password")

# >>> do what ever you want here <<<

# do NOT forget to logout
iserv.logout()
````

> #### ðŸ’¡ **Advise:** Time delay between requests
> Many requests in a short time period may seem suspicious to the server.
> 
> To prevent any issues with your account add a **random time delay** between requests.
> 
> You can do this as shown here:
> 
> ````python
> import time
> import random
> 
> # first request
> 
> # random break between two requests
> time.sleep(random.uniform(0.5, 10.0))
> 
> # second request
> ````
> 


### How to use all the features?
